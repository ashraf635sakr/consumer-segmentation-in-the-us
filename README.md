# Consumer Segmentation in the US

This project focuses on consumer segmentation in the United States using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The primary goals of the project are:

- Conduct complex exploratory data analysis (EDA) on one of the biggest datasets , and compare sub-populations using a side-by-side bar chart.
- Apply key concepts of unsupervised learning by building a k-means clustering model.
- Conduct feature selection for clustering based on variance.
- Reduce high-dimensional data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- Design, build, and deploy a Dash web application for interactive data visualization.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The initial step involves exploring the dataset to gain insights and compare sub-populations through a side-by-side bar chart.

- **K-Means Clustering:** We implement a k-means clustering model to segment consumers based on their behavior and attributes.

- **Feature Selection:** Feature selection is performed to identify and retain the most relevant variables for clustering by considering variance.

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** High-dimensional data is reduced using PCA to simplify the dataset while preserving essential information.

- **Dash Web Application:** We design, build, and deploy a Dash web application for interactive data visualization, making it easier to explore and understand the consumer segments.
